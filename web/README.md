# Cartpole GridViewer
This is an offline, quick-and-dirty prototype. It generates random cartpole configs and creates representative SVGs

## To Run
Open the index.html in Firefox. Mouse-over grid cells to see cartpole states & user actions

## TODO
* building blocks: timeline sweeper, action selector (swipe right vs left?)
* sample the space more methodically
* read in simulation run results
* convert to proper JS framework? (though jquery will be quicker if we're aiming for May)
