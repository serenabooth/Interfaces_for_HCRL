#Cartpole GridViewer
This is an offline, quick-and-dirty prototype. It generates random cartpole configs and creates SVGs

## To Run
Open the index.html in Firefox. Click on the grid cells to see the (unformatted) cartpole states

## TODO
* include arrows in viz
* sample the space more methodically
* read in simulation run results
* convert to proper JS framework? (though jquery will be quicker if we're aiming for May)
* create a timeline viewer
* link it up with python server
